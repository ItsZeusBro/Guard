# Guard
Guard is an interface impression/expression and protection mechanism. What it means for an interface to be impressive is how much context you can impress upon the function with the variable variables. Variable variables are variables that represent different variables based upon the context of the previous variables. The expression of the function is what you get out of the function, which is a one to one relationship with the impression mechanism.

The gurard protection mechanism is the automatic type guards generated by guard that keeps the impression/expression one to one relationship
